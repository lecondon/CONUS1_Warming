#These averages were calculated by Adam and copied from Powell

# NOTE 1: For the baseline runs the # ones are the original set of directories I used
and the second set are the actual set that Adam says should be used and that I swapped the
analysis over to.

#NOTE 2: Year 1 for the baseline run is a copy of '/data/CONUS/active/CONUS.pfclm.1985.run4/averages/averages'
so if there is some data missing you probably can go back and forth.
The storage came out almost exactly the same and I suspect any differences are form numerical
rounding errors.

#NOTE 3: Adam stared running baseline at year 5 and all perturbations from year4
